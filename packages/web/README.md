This package is part of the shieldbow library.

The shieldbow library allows you to easily interact with various aspects of the RIOT Games API
to develop third-party apps and services for League of Legends (LoL) and Teamfight Tactics (TFT).

This package is used to provide a smaller web version of the shieldbow library,
which can be used in the browser, and only exposes parts that do NOT require an API key
or a backend server, such as the Data Dragon CDN.
